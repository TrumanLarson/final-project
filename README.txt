We have created a draft simulator for league of legends. Users will create a randomized room code and join through there.
The first two clients will be assigned a side to pick from while any additional users will be assigned spectators.
Users will then draft in tournament draft order.
If you are having issues with picking, it is possible that you are selecting when it is not your turn.
This project cannot be used without at least two users, so please keep that in mind.
Yjs was used for multi device communication and server side authentication. React was used to deploy the webpage and add interactive elements
Challenges faced in completing the project: Deployment to hosting server, url parameters, Draft logic, CSS organization
Truman was in charge of the multi user functionality and backend.
Ryan was in charge of the UI deployment with react and css.
